# Admin-Dashboard

## Overview:
This is a Dashboard project that I built as part of TOP curriculum. The main goal of this project is to practice and improve my skills in building grid 
layouts and thats why you'll see that everything was laid out using css grid. However now after finishing the project and getting a deeper understanding 
of how easy it is to use the grid system in certaint cases and how difficult it is in other cases, if I had the choice of using whatever layout system I 
wanted I would probably use flexbox and the grid system together using the grid system to build the main layout of the page and using flexbox to build the 
layout of each individual section within that page.

## What I learned:
- How to use the grid system to build a full page layout.
- How to make an element take the least amount of space that it needs while making another element take the rest of the space using css grid
- How to create a gradient rounded border.
- How to position an element as fixed on the screen.
